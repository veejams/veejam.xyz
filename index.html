TEASER

EXT. COW PASTURE - DAY

Deep blue sky overhead. Fat, scuddy clouds. Below them, 

black and white cows graze the rolling hills. This could be 

one of those California “It’s The Cheese” commercials.

Except those commercials don’t normally focus on cow shit. 

We do. TILT DOWN to a fat, round PATTY drying olive drab in 

the sun. Flies buzz. Peaceful and quiet. Until...

... ZOOOM! WHEELS plow right through the shit with a SPLAT.

NEW ANGLE - AN RV

Is speeding smack-dab through the pasture, no road in sight. 

A bit out of place, to say the least. It’s an old 70’s era 

Winnebago with chalky white paint and Bondo spots. A bumper 

sticker for the Good Sam Club is stuck to the back.

The Winnebago galumphs across the landscape, scattering cows. 

It catches a wheel and sprays a rooster tail of red dirt.

INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY

Inside, the DRIVER’s knuckles cling white to the wheel. He’s 

got the pedal flat. Scared, breathing fast. His eyes bug 

wide behind the faceplate of his gas mask.

Oh, by the way, he’s wearing a GAS MASK. That, and white 

jockey UNDERPANTS. Nothing else.

Buckled in the seat beside him lolls a clothed PASSENGER, 

also wearing a gas mask. Blood streaks down from his ear, 

blotting his T-shirt. He’s passed out cold.

Behind them, the interior is a wreck. Beakers and buckets 

and flasks -- some kind of ad-hoc CHEMICAL LAB -- spill their 

noxious contents with every bump we hit. Yellow-brown liquid 

washes up and down the floor. It foams in a scum around...

... Two DEAD BODIES. Two freshly deceased Mexican guys 

tumble like rag dolls, bumping into each other.

Completing this picture is the blizzard of MONEY. A Von’s 

bag lies leaking twenties. Fifteen, twenty grand in cash 

wafts around in the air or floats in the nasty brown soup.

CLOSE on the driver’s eyes. He’s panting like a steam 

engine. His mask FOGS UP until finally he can’t see.
